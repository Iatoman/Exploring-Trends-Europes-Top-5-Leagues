In the report you can find reasoning behind visualisation stragergies, analysis and evaluation of the visualisations.

Vist the report [here](/Report.pdf).

## <a name="webpage"> How To View The Visualisations </a>

To display my visualisations I created a HTML page in order to utilise the interactivity in the graphs.

You can view the webpage by  :

* Downloading the Zip file containing the webpage files [here](/FIV_HTML.zip)
* Open the index.html file on your browser from within the FIV_HTML directory.

Here is what the page looks like:
